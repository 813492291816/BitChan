## 1.4.0 (2025/04/26)

Upgrading from version 1.3.0 can be performed with the following steps:

1. Stop docker containers: cd Bitchan/docker && docker compose down
2. Delete i2pd.conf: sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bitchan-docker/i2pd/i2pd.conf
3. Delete torrc: sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bitchan-docker/tor/torrc 
4. Get latest code: cd Bitchan && git pull 
5. Build Bitchan: cd Bitchan/docker && make daemon

After building, you may need to change the Bitmessage Connections option on the Config page before connections can occur.

## 1.3.0 (2024/04/20)

This release has several incompatibilities with v1.2.0, therefore v1.2.0 and v1.3.0 will not be able to communicate with each other. Due to significant changes, there isn't an option to upgrade from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0, so a clean install will need to be performed.

Notes on BitTorrent over I2P feature: The introduction of BitTorrent over I2P as a post attachment method removes the reliance on 3rd party upload sites for hosting attachment data and improves the privacy and security of the transmitted data. Only torrents with I2P trackers will function. Trackers with a TLD other than i2p are prohibited and will result in an error if you try to set non-I2P trackers on the configuration page or attempt to send or receive an attachment using BitTorrent over I2P using a non-I2P tracker.
